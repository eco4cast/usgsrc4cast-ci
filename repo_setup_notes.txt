Project Setup
•	Forked the neon4cast-ci repository from https://github.com/eco4cast/neon4cast-ci to the eco4cast GitHub organization, creating https://github.com/eco4cast/usgsrc4cast-ci.
•	As the repository administrator, I have admin privileges and can manage the repository.
•	Branches are used to test and utilize secrets without affecting the main repository.
GitHub Actions and Workflows
•	GitHub Actions and existing workflows are automatically disabled when forking a new repository and need to be updated and re-authorized.
•	Made changes to challenge details in the pull request https://github.com/eco4cast/usgsrc4cast-ci/pull/1.
Configuration File
•	It would be helpful to have separate sections for configuration settings that do not need to be changed and those that require updates based on the forecast challenge.
Challenge Drivers and Storage
•	Use a separate bucket or path for challenge drivers, rather than storing them in the neon4cast-drivers repository.
•	Example: https://github.com/eco4cast/neon4cast-ci/blob/6b15a88fbbf13e13f0ffe3abc0c9ffce17ef4bb9/drivers/generate_stage2.R#L7
Self-Hosted Runners
•	Self-hosted runners can be used, but require Quinn or Carl to add them to the repository in GitHub.
•	Refer to https://github.com/eco4cast/usgsrc4cast-ci/pull/17#discussion_r1445345447 for more information.
Registration and Models
•	Registration for the challenge is already set up at https://forms.gle/kg2Vkpho9BoMXSy57.
•	Climatology and random walk models need to be registered.
•	If already registered for a different challenge, the same model needs to be registered for the new challenge.
