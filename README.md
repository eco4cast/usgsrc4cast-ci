# Ecological Forecasting Initiative (EFI) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) River Chlorophyll Forecasting Challenge

The following elements of a forecasting challenge workflow are included in this repo.  The GitHub Actions are the tool for automating the tasks.

1) Generation of targets
3) Processing of submissions
4) Download of weather drivers for forecasts
5) Generation of baseline forecasts
6) Evaluation (scoring) of submitted forecasts
7) Generation of dashboard
8) Generation of catalog
9) Creation of Docker containers with supporting software
10) Creation of archive/snapshots of challenge submissions and targets.

See [https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2616](https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2616) for more information on the structure of a forecasting challenge, using the NEON forecasting challenge as the example.
