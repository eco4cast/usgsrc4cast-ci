You can represent your confidence (i.e., uncertainty in the forecast) using a distribution or numerically using an ensemble (or sample) of predictions.\n\n\n2.3 Any model drivers/covariates/features are welcome\nYou can use any data as model inputs (including all of the forecast target data available to date). All target data are available in with a 1 day delay (latency) from time of collection. You may want to use the updated target data to re-train a model or for use in data assimilation.\nAs a genuine forecasting challenge, you will need forecasted drivers if your model uses drivers as inputs. If you are interested in using forecasted meteorology, we are downloading and processing NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) weather forecasts for each USGS site. The NOAA GEFS forecasts extend 35-days ahead. More information about accessing the weather forecasts can be found here\n\n\n2.4 Forecasts extend out to 30 days in the future\nForecasts can be submitted for 1 to 30 days ahead. See the variable tables for the horizon that is associated with each variable.\n\n\n2.5 Forecasts can be submitted everyday\nSince forecasts can be submitted everyday, automation is important. We provide an example GitHub repository for both R and Python that can be used to automate your forecast with GitHub Actions. It also includes the use of a custom Docker Container for R (eco4cast/rocker-neon4cast:latest) or Python (eco4cast/usgsrc4cast-python:latest) that has many of the packages and functions needed to generate and submit forecasts."

This is referred to as a “perfect ensemble” by Bröcker and Smith (2007).
