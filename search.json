You can represent your confidence (i.e., uncertainty in the forecast) using a distribution or numerically using an ensemble (or sample) of predictions.\n\n\n2.3 Any model drivers/covariates/features are welcome\nYou can use any data as model inputs (including all of the forecast target data available to date). All target data are available in with a 1 day delay (latency) from time of collection. You may want to use the updated target data to re-train a model or for use in data assimilation.\nAs a genuine forecasting challenge, you will need forecasted drivers if your model uses drivers as inputs. If you are interested in using forecasted meteorology, we are downloading and processing NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) weather forecasts for each USGS site. The NOAA GEFS forecasts extend 35-days ahead. More information about accessing the weather forecasts can be found here\n\n\n2.4 Forecasts extend out to 30 days in the future\nForecasts can be submitted for 1 to 30 days ahead. See the variable tables for the horizon that is associated with each variable.\n\n\n2.5 Forecasts can be submitted everyday\nSince forecasts can be submitted everyday, automation is important. We provide an example GitHub repository for both R and Python that can be used to automate your forecast with GitHub Actions. It also includes the use of a custom Docker Container for R (eco4cast/rocker-neon4cast:latest) or Python (eco4cast/usgsrc4cast-python:latest) that has many of the packages and functions needed to generate and submit forecasts."

This is referred to as a “perfect ensemble” by Bröcker and Smith (2007). Ensemble (or sample) forecasts are transformed to a probability distribution function (e.g., dressed) using the default methods in the scoringRules R package (empirical version of the quantile decomposition for the crps).\n\n\n5.1 Example forecasts\nHere is an example of a forecast that uses a normal distribution:\n\ndf &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/forecasts/raw/project_id=usgsrc4cast/T20240813050531_usgsrc4cast-2024-08-12-climatology.csv.gz\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\ndf |&gt; \n  head() |&gt; \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nproject_id\nmodel_id\ndatetime\nreference_datetime\nduration\nsite_id\nfamily\nparameter\nvariable\nprediction\n\n\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\nclimatology\n2024-08-13\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nnormal\nmu\nchla\n1.493576\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\nclimatology\n2024-08-13\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nnormal\nsigma\nchla\n0.874529\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\nclimatology\n2024-08-14\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nnormal\nmu\nchla\n1.657496\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\nclimatology\n2024-08-14\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nnormal\nsigma\nchla\n0.874529\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\nclimatology\n2024-08-15\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nnormal\nmu\nchla\n1.722410\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\nclimatology\n2024-08-15\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nnormal\nsigma\nchla\n0.874529\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an ensemble (or sample) forecast, the family column uses the word ensemble to designate that it is a ensemble forecast and the parameter column is the ensemble member number (1, 2, 3 …)\n\ndf &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/forecasts/raw/project_id=usgsrc4cast/T20240813050531_usgsrc4cast-2024-08-12-persistenceRW.csv.gz\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\ndf |&gt; \n  dplyr::arrange(variable, site_id, datetime, parameter) |&gt; \n  head() |&gt; \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nproject_id\nmodel_id\ndatetime\nreference_datetime\nduration\nsite_id\nfamily\nparameter\nvariable\nprediction\n\n\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\npersistenceRW\n2024-08-13\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nensemble\n1\nchla\n1.684588\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\npersistenceRW\n2024-08-13\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nensemble\n2\nchla\n2.198210\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\npersistenceRW\n2024-08-13\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nensemble\n3\nchla\n1.680515\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\npersistenceRW\n2024-08-13\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nensemble\n4\nchla\n4.687647\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\npersistenceRW\n2024-08-13\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nensemble\n5\nchla\n2.029173\n\n\nusgsrc4cast\npersistenceRW\n2024-08-13\n2024-08-12\nP1D\nUSGS-01427510\nensemble\n6\nchla\n1.524530"

We can begin to realize this vision by creating and analyzing a catalog of forecasts from a range of ecological systems, spatiotemporal scales, and environmental gradients.\nOur forecasting challenge is a platform for the ecological and data science communities to advance skills in forecasting ecological systems and for generating forecasts that contribute to a synthetic understanding of patterns of environmental predictability. Rewards for contributing are skill advancement, joy, and potential involvement in manuscripts. We do not currently crown winner nor offer financial awards.\nThe original NEON forecasting challenge has been an excellent focal project in university courses and this EFI-USGS challenge could be used as classroom projects as well.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal forecasts submitted to the EFI-USGS Challenge\n1632\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost recent data for model training\n2025-07-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of years of data for model training\n16.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of variables being forecasted\n1"
