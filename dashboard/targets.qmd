```{r  message=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
aquatics_focal_sites <- c("USGS-05553700", "USGS-01463500")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
target_metadata <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/usgsrc4cast-ci/prod/targets/in/controlled_vocab_targets.csv")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
target_metadata <- target_metadata |> 
  rename(variable = `"official" targets name`) |> 
  select(variable, duration, class, Description, horizon, Latency)
```

## tl;dr: Forecast the targets!

The "targets" are time-series of United States Geological Survey ([USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/)) data for use in model development and forecast evaluation.

The targets are updated as new USGS data are made available.

This challenge focuses on forecasting river chlorophyll-a at select USGS monitoring locations. The links to targets files are included below.

## Where to start {#sec-starting-sites}

<!-- If are you are getting started, we recommend the following focal sites for each of the five "themes". -->
<!-- The first site in the list is the recommended starting site. -->

<!-- -   Aquatics: `r aquatics_focal_sites` -->

As you develop your forecasting skills and want to expand to more sites, the targets are available at all 10 USGS sites.
You may also consider submitting forecasts to sites that match your interests.
For example, a class being taught in the winter may be more interested in forecasting southern sites while a summer class may focus on more northern sites.

More information about USGS sites can be found in the [site metadata](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/usgs4cast-ci/main/catalog/sites/collection.json) and on USGS's [website](https://dashboard.waterdata.usgs.gov/app/nwd/en/)

## Explore the targets and themes {#sec-targets}

Information on the targets files for the "themes" is below.
In the tables,

-   "duration" is the time-step of the variable where `P1D` is a daily mean.

-   The "forecast horizon" is the number of days-ahead that we want you to forecast.

-   The "latency" is the time between data collection and data availability in the targets file


### Aquatics

![](https://projects.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-catalog/img/neon_buoy.jpg)

The aquatics theme challenges you to forecast daily mean water quality variables at up-to 10 river USGS sites.

```{r echo = FALSE}
url <- "https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/targets/project_id=usgsrc4cast/duration=P1D/river-chl-targets.csv.gz"
read_csv(url, show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  distinct(variable, duration) |> 
  left_join(target_metadata, by = c("variable","duration")) |> 
  filter(variable %in% c("chla")) |> 
  select(-class) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

The daily mean target file is located at the following URL.

```{r}
url <- "https://sdsc.osn.xsede.org/bio230014-bucket01/challenges/targets/project_id=usgsrc4cast/duration=P1D/river-chl-targets.csv.gz"
```

You can directly load it into R using the following

```{r}
aquatics_targets <- read_csv(url, show_col_types = FALSE)
```

The file contains the following columns

```{r echo = FALSE}
aquatics_targets |> 
  na.omit() |> 
  head() |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

and the time series for the focal sites

```{r}
aquatics_targets |> 
  filter(site_id %in% aquatics_focal_sites) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = datetime, y = observation)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~site_id, scales = "free") +
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("Chlorophyll-a (ug/L)")
```


## Explore the sites

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
sites <- suppressMessages(sf::st_read("sites.json"))
```

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=5, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, message = FALSE}
leaflet() %>%
  setView(lat = 43.47839356422085, lng = -98.74777398430538, zoom= 2) %>%
  addTiles(group="OSM") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldImagery, group="Imagery") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldTopoMap, group="Topo Map") %>%
  addLayersControl(baseGroups=c('Imagery','OSM', 'Topo Map')) |> 
  addMarkers(data  = sites, popup=~as.character(site_id), group = ~as.character(Partner), clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```

<br /> <br /> The following table lists all the sites in the EFI-USGS Ecological Forecasting Challenge.
The columns with "theme" names incidate whether that site is included in that theme's target file.

```{r echo = FALSE}
site_list <- read_csv("../USGS_site_metadata.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  select(site_id, site_no, station_nm, site_url) 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
site_list |> knitr::kable()
```
