  "description": "The catalog contains NOAA forecasts used for the EFI-USGS River Chlorophyll Forecasting Challenge. The forecasts are the raw forecasts that include all ensemble members (if a forecast represents uncertainty using an ensemble). You can access the forecasts at the top level of the dataset where all models, variables, and dates that forecasts were produced (reference_datetime) are available. The code to access the entire dataset is provided as an asset. Given the size of the forecast catalog, it can be time-consuming to access the data at the full dataset level. For quicker access to the forecasts for a site or datetime, we also provide the code to access the data at the site_id and datetime level as an asset for each forecast",
